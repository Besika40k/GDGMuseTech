# GDG-MuseTech
## About the Project
GDG-MuseTech was developed by a team of five for a hackathon. Unfortunately, one team member went missing in action (didn't show up), leaving the following contributors:
    Lile Endeladze
    Salome Mikadze
    Ani Jvarsheishvili
    Besik Meskhia
    ...and our unnamed, absent teammate

This project is a web-based implementation of the AI model "Kona",
designed to simplify and enhance the prompting experience for Georgian teachers. 
It achieves this by incorporating visual cues for frequently used prompts
and providing structured options to streamline the process.


## Tech Stack
    Front-End: React, HTML, CSS
    Back-End: Python (FastAPI)
    AI Model: "Kona" (ChatGPT-based) â€“ Developed by Tbilisi AI Lab
